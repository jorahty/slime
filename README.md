# Slime

This project has two parts that communicate using Socket.io:
1. `Server` using Matter.js (intended for deployment to Replit)
2. `Client` using Expo & React Native

## Usage

* Create `Client/.env` and set the socket endpoint:
  ```
  SOCKET_ENDPOINT="https://slime.jorahty.repl.co"
  ```
  The server listens on port 3000, so I either set the socket endpoint:
  - to the Repl's URL: `https://slime.jorahty.repl.co`,
  - to `http://localhost:3000`,
  - or using the IP address of my machine (which I get with
  `ipconfig getifaddr en0`) e.g `http://172.19.248.44:3000`.

- Install node packages: `npm install`
- Start the server: `npm run start:server`
- Start the client: `npm run start:client`

## Todo

- draw something locally
- draw something from the server


end goal:
low latency networked dial with expo client
perfect controls
multiple clients experiencing the same physics

straight to the point:
networked dial? reuse code
square canvas component that renders updates as frames
controls component that uses the input snack and emits input signals


- Setup git repo, Assert that deployment to replit works, Make template, Get a stable, production feeling github workflow thing going
- Check performance on replit
- Start drawing shapes on the Client
- Setup Matter.js on the Server
- Start rendering state from Matter.js world on Server
- eslint
- basic tests â€” start very basic. just something that proves everything isn't entirely broken and has some code coverage
- github workflow checks
- render table of connected users to server terminal output
